<p>This is some <u>mispeled</u> text.</p>
The <u> tag represents some text that is unarticulated and
    styled differently from normal text, such as misspelled words
    or proper names in Chinese text. The content inside is
    typically displayed with an underline. You can change this
    with CSS (see example below).
